        <h2>JavqScript</h2>
        <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. 
        <br>The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. 
        <br>This quickly became the most-used.
        <br>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. 
        <br>There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. 
        <br>They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.
        <br>The goal was a "language for the masses","to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".
        <br>Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.
        <br>Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December
